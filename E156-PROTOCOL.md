## `[367]` Coronary IVL: A Transparent Living Meta-Analysis v13

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: RR  
**Data:** ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, OpenAlex

### 156-word body

Can a browser-based transparent living meta-analysis reproduce published pooled estimates for coronary intravascular lithotripsy for calcified lesions? The v13 app ingested 6 RCTs from ClinicalTrials.gov cross-checked against PubMed and OpenAlex. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects pooling with HKSJ correction ran in-browser on the logged risk ratio, with cumulative, provenance, QA, and cross-validation engines logging every step. The pooled risk ratio was concordant with the Kereiakes 2021 DISRUPT series benchmark within lockdown tolerance, and estimates update live as trials are ingested. Cross-validation against R metafor and Python scipy scripts reproduced the pooled point estimate, and leave-one-out plus REML-versus-HKSJ sensitivity preserved direction. A transparent browser-native pipeline matches benchmark pooled effects for coronary intravascular lithotripsy for calcified lesions without server-side computation while surfacing every provenance decision. The app inherits CT.gov and PubMed coverage gaps, cannot synthesize unpublished data, and updates require manual re-ingestion.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
